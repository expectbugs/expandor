# Remaining Style Issues After Automated Formatting

## Summary
- **Original warnings**: 712
- **After formatting**: 166
- **Reduction**: 77%

## Automated fixes applied:
1. ✅ isort - Fixed import ordering
2. ✅ autopep8 - Fixed basic PEP8 issues
3. ✅ black - Applied consistent formatting with 88-char line length

## Remaining issues by category:

### 1. Unused imports (F401) - ~80 warnings
These are imports that are not used in the file. Many are intentional for re-exporting in __init__.py files.

**Examples:**
- `expandor/adapters/__init__.py`: Adapter classes imported for public API
- Various utility imports that may be used in future implementations

**Action needed**: Review each and either remove or add `# noqa: F401` for intentional re-exports

### 2. Line too long (E501) - ~50 warnings
Lines exceeding 88 characters that black couldn't automatically fix (usually in strings or comments).

**Examples:**
- Long error messages in NotImplementedError
- URLs in documentation strings
- Complex string formatting

**Action needed**: Manual line breaking or use `# noqa: E501` for URLs/paths

### 3. Missing placeholders in f-strings (F541) - 1 warning
- `expandor/adapters/diffusers_adapter.py:211`: f-string without placeholders

**Action needed**: Change to regular string

### 4. Other minor issues (~35 warnings)
- Undefined names in TYPE_CHECKING blocks
- Complex type annotations
- Lambda expressions that could be def

## Recommended approach:
1. Fix the f-string issue (critical)
2. Review unused imports and add noqa comments where appropriate
3. Address line length issues in docstrings manually
4. Leave type-checking related warnings as they don't affect runtime

## Note on Phase 5:
Many of these warnings are in placeholder code (ComfyUI/A1111 adapters) that will be properly implemented in Phase 5. These can be ignored for now.
